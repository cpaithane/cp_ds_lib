What I learned from my Valgrind tryouts : 

===============

Valgrind error symptom : invalid write of 1 byte.

1. strlen returns output excluding '/0' character. So, if malloc or character array
is used to allocating memory, allocate strlen(str) + 1 number of bytes.

2. Also, string should terminate with '/0' character. Something like as follow :
str[strlen(str)] = '\0';
