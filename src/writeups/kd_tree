1. K-Dimensional tree is a binary tree whose main use case is such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees

Insertion/search into K-Dimensional tree :

For example, k = 2. That means, every point has x and y dimensions.

1. It happens similar to binary search tree except on even level, values from x axis are matched and on odd level, values from y axis are matched.
