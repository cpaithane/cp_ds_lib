1. Insertion into BTree : Same as that of B+ tree.
2. Deletion from BTree : Two cases :

a. If the key to delete is at leaf, level delete it.
b. if key is in internal node, check whether children nodes are mergeable.
b.1 : If merge able, merge the two children.
b.2 : If not merge able, then find out inorder predecessor of the key. Replace inorder predecessor with the key.
