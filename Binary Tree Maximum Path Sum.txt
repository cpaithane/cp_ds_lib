Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Input: root = [-15,10,20,null,null,15,5,-5]

Output: 40

Explanation: The path is 15 -> 20 -> 5 with a sum of 15 + 20 + 5 = 40.

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the given tree.

            # Sum of left_max, right_max and root.val becomes the sum of path
            # But, return root.val + max(left_max, right_max) to the parent
            # as we need to consider the max sum path.
