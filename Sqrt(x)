Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1

class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = x
        res = 0

        while l <= r:
            m = l + (r - l)//2

            if m * m > x:
                r = m - 1
            elif m * m < x:
                res = m
                l = m + 1
            else:
                return m

        return res
