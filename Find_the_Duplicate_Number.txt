Find the Duplicate Number

You are given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers. Each integer in nums is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. Return the integer that appears more than once.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,2]

Output: 2

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]

Output: 4

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using 

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the size of the input array.

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            # Check if the v is at its right pos
            if i == (v - 1):
                continue

            # v is not at right position
            # Check if v and num at right pos are equal
            # If they are equal, then return nums[i]
            # Else, swap.
            if v == nums[nums[i] - 1]:
                return v

            tmp = v
            nums[i] = nums[v - 1]
            nums[v - 1] = tmp

        return -1
